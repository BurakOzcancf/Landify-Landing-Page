# Landify-Landing-Page
Hello! My name's Burak Ã–zcan. This is my solution to the Landify page. The task was building Landify one page with just HTML/CSS.

### About The Challenge

    -- Challenge is to build out this page and get it looking same to the design.
    -- This challenge focuses on HTML & CSS.
    --This project was made without JS or any frameworks. In this project, a menu could be makeable by using ":hover" however I have not preferred the kind of menu without JS.
    -- There are 3 breakpoints for mobile, tablet and for desktop.Breakpoints are 375px-768px-1440px.

### Cared and Used

- CSS variable for colours
- Screen reader friendly
- Basic animations, hovers and focus-visible

Created focus-visible styling to interactive elements to navigate this website using the keyboard (by using the Tab key) easily.

All the page content is live inside landmark elements (header, nav, main, and footer).
